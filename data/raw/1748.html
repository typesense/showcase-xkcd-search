<p>This Wednesday comic is a direct continuation of the previous comic <a href="/wiki/index.php/1747:_Spider_Paleontology" title="1747: Spider Paleontology">1747: Spider Paleontology</a> from Monday about a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_travel" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Time travel">time-traveler</a> (the black floating energy Sphere) who has come back from far in to the future to see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiders" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Spiders">spiders</a> (only known from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossils" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Fossils">fossils</a> in their time). See <a href="/wiki/index.php/1747:_Spider_Paleontology" title="1747: Spider Paleontology">1747: Spider Paleontology</a> for a more complete explanation of this part of the joke. This series ended with this comic. Both comics in this series have titles of a noun followed by a field of research.
</p><p>Since <a href="/wiki/index.php/Megan" title="Megan">Megan</a> and <a href="/wiki/index.php/Cueball" title="Cueball">Cueball</a> now have access to the Sphere from the future they ask if it knows who will win the election. This is a reference to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_elections,_2016" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:United States elections, 2016">United States elections, 2016</a> where the <i>very</i> controversial <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Donald Trump">Donald Trump</a> was up against former United States First Lady <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Hillary Clinton">Hillary Clinton</a>, who also had several <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton#Email_controversy" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Hillary Clinton">controversies</a> going on. This comic was released about three weeks before election day. It is likely one of the most discussed elections ever, especially in the rest of the world outside the US, where especially European leaders have made it clear that they are against Trump. That was mainly earlier on, before they realized he might actually stand a chance. Of course anyone interested in any election would be interested to hear from the future how it went, but this particular election may interest a larger proportion of the world population than any prior election. (The election was the subject three weeks later the day before the election where <a href="/wiki/index.php/Randall" class="mw-redirect" title="Randall">Randall</a> endorsed Hillary directly in <a href="/wiki/index.php/1756:_I%27m_With_Her" title="1756: I&#39;m With Her">1756: I'm With Her</a>.)
</p><p>Sadly for Megan and Cueball, the sphere has come back from so far in to the future, that even spiders have gone extinct. (Whether humans also have is unclear, see discussion about this in <a href="/wiki/index.php/1747:_Spider_Paleontology" title="1747: Spider Paleontology">1747: Spider Paleontology</a>). The Sphere makes this clear by stating that its civilization hardly know anything about our era and they know little about our history and culture. (And by the way it only came back for the spiders, anyway). 
</p><p>The idea is that history is filtered in similar fashion to fossils.  What is contemporaneously important, like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider_web" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Spider web">spider's web</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feathered_dinosaur" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Feathered dinosaur">dinosaur feathers</a> (see previous comic), or the United States presidential election may not survive. The Sphere tells them that only two written accounts have been reconstructed (note that they are not found in their entirety). And they do not know if they even represents real events or myths. One of the two is indeed a myth, as it is about a man building a boat to survive a great flood. Megan recognizes this as being about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Noah">Noah</a> and his famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah%27s_Ark" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Noah&#39;s Ark">Ark</a> from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genesis_flood_narrative" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Genesis flood narrative">Genesis flood narrative</a>, as Cueball refers to. The other is a reference to a popular pop song.
</p><p>The joke is that, in the future, the 2000 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Carter" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Aaron Carter">Aaron Carter</a> hip hop song "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/That%27s_How_I_Beat_Shaq" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:That&#39;s How I Beat Shaq">That's How I Beat Shaq</a>" (<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/aaroncarter/thatshowibeatshaq.html">lyrics</a> and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfhhWA9GF0M">video</a>) is considered as valuable a historical document when researching humans as parts of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Bible">Bible</a>.
</p><p>While secular historians consider the story of the Flood to be mythical, they still use it to infer facts about the early history of the Middle East, simply because there are a fairly small number of texts surviving from that era. "That's How I Beat Shaq" is, likewise, a fictional story including some true elements; it's just that as long as there are abundant sources documenting life in the year 2000, there's no reason to consult the song in any historical context. Yet it is the latter story that the time traveler assumes to be a clearly religious one, while seeing the former as a relatively straightforward survival story. A further layer of humor is that "That's How I Beat Shaq" is an archetypal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_and_Goliath" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:David and Goliath">David and Goliath</a> story&#8212;the story of David and Goliath of course being a Biblical one as well. 
</p><p>In fact the Spheres civilization believes Shaq (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaquille_O%27Neal" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Shaquille O&#39;Neal">Shaquille O'Neal</a> a professional basketball player 2.16 m (7 ft 1 in) tall) to refer to a god, which was then defeated by Aaron, a 14 year old (and rather small kid) at the time of the release of his single in 2001. He beats Shaq on the basketball court one on one, so although this is a David vs. Goliath story it is not a fight till death. But to Aaron and his basketball fan friends, Shaq is probably seen as kind of god. Megan comments that the pop song may have been mangled by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeon" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Aeon">eons</a>.
</p><p>The title text expands on the joke by letting the Sphere explain that the only connection they have found between their two historical documents is via the biblical story of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Moses">Moses</a>. As Moses is also one of God's chosen prophets and leaders, like Noah and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Abraham">Abraham</a> before him, these two stories appear close together in the Bible, though not close together chronologically, and it would be likely that their document with the Flood story also has some parts about Moses. Moses had an older biological brother named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Aaron">Aaron</a> and the Sphere's civilization has hastily concluded that Moses' brother and Aaron Carter are one and the same. According to the Bible, God <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parting_of_the_Red_Sea" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Parting of the Red Sea">parted the Sea of Reeds (commonly mistranslated as Red Sea)</a> for Moses and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israelites" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Israelites">Israelites</a>. This is often referred to, either erroneously or out of simplification, as Moses having parted the Red Sea. Along with Noah's Flood, this is one of the two major times in the Bible that God effects grand change on a body or bodies of water. 
</p><p>The Sphere asks Megan and Cueball if it is true that Aaron (Carter's) brother Moses did part an ocean. Megan decides to refrain from trying to explain this, having already in the previous comic realized how hard it is to explain spiders to someone who is a fan, but has never heard of spider web, and thus just states yes, yes exactly. Of course according to the Bible she can say yes to the question about Moses parting the water, as long as she does not say anything about the connection with Aaron Carter.
</p><p>There appears to be a major flaw in the comic on the fact that the Sphere speaks perfect English, and understands Megan and Cueball. If they only have two written accounts from our time, why do they then speak English? Especially since they seem to come from another planet and are thus likely not humans (see discussion of the sphere in the previous comic). Of course if they are humans and have come from Earth (maybe traveled away), they may just have retained the English language. But given the fact that young people today probably would not understand their own grandparents' grandparents, and that the Sphere is from so long into the future that Megan calls it eons, spiders are extinct, and only two texts have survived, it should be impossible for the language to have stayed the same. Alternatively they have also recovered some video clips, but then it would be strange the Sphere did not mention this. A final solution is that the Sphere's civilization is so advanced that it can learn the language instantly by just being in the room with other beings, simply reading it from their mind. Given the fact that it seems the Sphere has come to Earth from another planet, and has the ability to travel in time, this last option may not even be so far-fetched.
</p><p>This comic was published the day after the <a href="/wiki/index.php/what_if%3F" class="mw-redirect" title="what if?">what if?</a> <i><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://what-if.xkcd.com/152">Flood Death Valley</a></i>, thus referring indirectly to a new possible flood history. It was the first what if? post in almost three months, the longest break between two post during 2016 (and third longest of all time at the time of its release), and it thus seems realistic that there should be some kind of connection between that and this comic. A later comic (<a href="/wiki/index.php/1750:_Life_Goals" title="1750: Life Goals">1750: Life Goals</a>) also referenced this what if? post more or less directly.
</p><p>In this comic Randall manages to combine no less than four of his favorite recurring subjects with <a href="/wiki/index.php/Category:Time_travel" title="Category:Time travel">time travel</a>, <a href="/wiki/index.php/Category:Spiders" title="Category:Spiders">spiders</a>, <a href="/wiki/index.php/Category:Politics" title="Category:Politics">politics</a> and <a href="/wiki/index.php/Category:Religion" title="Category:Religion">religion</a>.

<dl><dt>A rare type of series?</dt></dl>
<p><small>{sorry if it sounds dumb: first time here}</small> Have any two consecutive xkcds ever been part of such a clear "series" without being labelled "part I", "part II", ...? Or is this a rare occurrence of such thing?

<p>Someone should make a character page for the time traveler dot dude. This is at least the third time xe has appeared. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/173.245.48.69" title="Special:Contributions/173.245.48.69">173.245.48.69</a> 13:15, 19 October 2016 (UTC)

<dl><dd>No. As noted in the previous comic there is no reason to assume that previous dots are the same. The Category should be deleted. But later when finding out if there are more than these two comics to come a series category should be created with a good name not this one that has been used: Category:Comics featuring the floating sphere from the future... --<a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Kynde" title="User:Kynde">Kynde</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Kynde" title="User talk:Kynde">talk</a>) 19:28, 19 October 2016 (UTC)

<dd>"xe"? Seriously?</dd>
<dd> This is the internet. We exclusively use spivak [e/em/eir] here (like Agora), as it was created out of necessity, not a desire to not offend anyone. <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Hppavilion1" title="User:Hppavilion1">Hppavilion1</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Hppavilion1" title="User talk:Hppavilion1">talk</a>) 07:20, 26 October 2016 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Which sounds more reasonable?</dt></dl>
<p>I think there's another layer to this comic not yet address by this page. 
</p><p>From Future Dot's perspective, a man building a boat to survive a flood sounds like a real event. A man challenging and defeating a God, less so.
</p><p>However, in modern times, the story of Noah's Flood is widely regarded as a myth, while the music video is widely regarded as having actually happened. 
</p><p>I believe this comic is meant to make us ask "What stories that we dismiss as myths have a kernel, however small, of truth to them?".

</p><p><br />
So far the comics in this series have had the name pattern [noun] [field of science ending in -ology]. Too perfect to be a coincidence. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:CJB42&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:CJB42 (page does not exist)">CJB42</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:CJB42&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:CJB42 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 17:36, 19 October 2016 (UTC)

<p>So if I'm right, I believe there has not been any consecutive continuity in xkcd since <a href="/wiki/index.php/Category:The_Race" title="Category:The Race">The Race</a>, which ended a little over seven  ago.... <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Schiffy" title="User:Schiffy"><font color="000999">Schiffy</font></a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Schiffy" title="User talk:Schiffy"><font color="FF6600">Speak to me</font></a>|<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/Schiffy" title="Special:Contributions/Schiffy"><font color="FF0000">What I've done</font></a>) 20:45, 19 October 2016 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>Not unless you count the vague continuity in the five-minute-comic series.--<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:KirkLand&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:KirkLand (page does not exist)">KirkLand</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:KirkLand&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:KirkLand (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 22:16, 19 October 2016 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Yes I agree that this series is special, mainly because the strips are released consecutively, but not dayfly and secondly because the naming is completely different not like the series. Once the Friday comic is revealed to be either related or not, some good naming for this series should be invented and these facts about this kind of series deviation from other series should be mentioned there (and referenced from each comic). --<a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Kynde" title="User:Kynde">Kynde</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Kynde" title="User talk:Kynde">talk</a>) 10:01, 21 October 2016 (UTC)

<p>Any chance the human characters were mistaken in interpreting Future Dot's flood story as Noah's? It seems possible - perhaps equally likely - that Future Dot had found <a href="/wiki/index.php/1190:_Time" title="1190: Time">1190: Time</a>. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:DemetriosBloodstone&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:DemetriosBloodstone (page does not exist)">DemetriosBloodstone</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:DemetriosBloodstone&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:DemetriosBloodstone (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 03:43, 20 October 2016 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>It's also possible that during the time, Noah's arch story and <a href="/wiki/index.php/1190:_Time" title="1190: Time">1190: Time</a> got mixed together (along with several other similar stories). -- <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Hkmaly" title="User:Hkmaly">Hkmaly</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Hkmaly" title="User talk:Hkmaly">talk</a>) 15:32, 20 October 2016 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>Note: There shouldn't be any bandwidth problem in future: Windows 3000 will likely require 1TB just for boot sector. The problem wouldn't be not enough information, but too much information with hardly any way to determine what was important. -- <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Hkmaly" title="User:Hkmaly">Hkmaly</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Hkmaly" title="User talk:Hkmaly">talk</a>) 15:32, 20 October 2016 (UTC)

<dl><dt>New character?</dt></dl>
<p>Should we consider the future organism a new character, since it has appeared in two <b>consecutive</b> strips.

</p>
<dl><dd>No, we should not make a new character page because anything or anyone appears twice. That is too little. But of course these two comics belongs together and should be made into a series. But let's wait and see if there are one more to come today Friday. The naming of the comic series is not clear yet as the names of the comics is not related.
