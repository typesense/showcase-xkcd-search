One is holding a laptop.]]\nPerson #1 (with laptop): What's the deal with this leukemia trial? {{Citation: Nejm, Aug 10, 2011}}\nPerson #2: Gotta wait and see.\nPerson #2: Helping the immune system attack tumors has been a longtime research target.\nPerson #2: Lots of promising leads. Often they don't pan out.\n\nPerson #1: What'd these guys do?\nPerson #2: They took some of the patient's T-cells and patched their genes so they'd attack the cancer. That hasn't been enough in the past but their patch also added code to get the T-cells to replicate wildly and persist in the body.\n\nPerson #1: Which worked, but created its own set of problems?\nPerson #2: How'd you guess? But I think the craziest part is the way they insert the patched genes.\nPerson #1: How?\nPerson #2: Well, think - What specializes in invading and modifying T-cells?\nPerson #1: Seriously?\nPerson #2: Yup. Must've been a fun conversation.\n\n[[The last panel is set in a doctors office. A patient is sitting on the observation bed talking to their doctor.]]\nPatient: Ok, so I have blood cells growing out of control, so you're going to give me different blood cells that *also* grow out of control?\nDoctor: Yes, but it's ok, because we've treated *this* blood with HIV!\nPatient: Are you sure you're a doctor?\nDoctor: Almost definitely.\n\n{{Title text: 'We're not sure how to wipe out the chimeral T-cells after they've destroyed the cancer.
