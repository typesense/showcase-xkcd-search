<p><a href="/wiki/index.php/Randall" class="mw-redirect" title="Randall">Randall</a>'s then-fiancée, now wife was diagnosed with cancer in late 2010. This is a matter he has discussed in the comic <a href="/wiki/index.php/Category:Cancer" title="Category:Cancer">multiple times before</a>, with Randall being depicted as Cueball and his wife as Megan. It has been 10 years since her diagnosis and treatments.
</p><p>This comic is a continuation of <a href="/wiki/index.php/1141:_Two_Years" title="1141: Two Years">1141: Two Years</a> and <a href="/wiki/index.php/1928:_Seven_Years" title="1928: Seven Years">1928: Seven Years</a>, which are shown in the first 16 panels, slightly grayed out.
</p><p>The first of the new panels shows Randall and his wife at a "Rabbit Rescue", interacting with buns (<a href="/wiki/index.php/Category:Buns" title="Category:Buns">a recurring theme</a> of xkcd).  The purpose of such events is to get rescued (often surrendered or seized) rabbits or other animals used to interacting with each other and with unfamiliar humans under controlled circumstances, to help them be more suitable as pets and hopefully entice visitors to adopt them.  Randall facetiously asks his wife if she thinks the rabbits have socialized enough, even though he and his wife are there for the sake of their own enjoyment (and she indicates that she would like to spend more time patting a bunny on its head).
</p><p>In the next panel, Randall is pushing his wife in a handcart, which is presumably stolen. (As evidenced by the off-panel person asking if anybody has seen the handcart.)
</p><p>The third new panel shows Randall and his wife exploring a mountain. They appear to have found something interesting, due to Megan pointing her finger towards something off-panel. It appears to be a reference to a similar climbing scene from <a href="/wiki/index.php/1190:_Time" title="1190: Time">1190: Time</a>.
</p><p>The fourth panel shows Randall and his wife sitting on the edge of a pier, looking at the night sky. This is a typical romantic nighttime activity. The panel is distinguished because there was considerably more effort put into the drawing of this panel than of the other panels, by virtue of it being nighttime. Thus, the reflection of the starlight on their faces is the center of attention in the drawing.
</p><p>The final new panels show Randall and his wife sitting on a hill, talking about how they couldn't believe that Megan would make it to 10 years cancer-free, which according to <a href="/wiki/index.php/881:_Probability" title="881: Probability">881: Probability</a> wasn't all that certain (77% probability -- <a href="/wiki/index.php/2379:_Probability_Comparisons" title="2379: Probability Comparisons">the probability of picking an M&amp;M out of a bag at random and getting one that isn't blue</a>). Randall's wife voices a concern that she had seemingly been carrying for a while, that she was a burden to Randall, and explains that she couldn't understand why he would marry her, except as a show of grace. Randall firmly rejects this notion, stating that it was no mere gesture, but that it was important to him that they enjoy "whatever time we could have".
</p><p>Finally, and as with the first comic in the series, the comic takes a light-hearted turn: because the table does not include values for probability of survival more than ten years after treatment, Randall's wife jokingly concludes that she is now immortal, perhaps thanks to a cursed artifact.  Many anniversaries are traditionally marked by giving gifts, such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_jubilee" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Silver jubilee">silver jubilee</a> after twenty-five years of marriage (or of a monarch's reign, or an employee's seniority within a company, or anything else).  The tenth anniversary is traditionally associated with a tin gift (tin being a much more precious metal <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.bartleby.com/95/22.html">in 1922</a> than it is today), but maybe Randall bought it at <a href="/wiki/index.php/2376:_Curbside" title="2376: Curbside">a cursed shop</a>.
</p><p>The title-text expands on this final joke, as it suggests that there is an official name for this giving of cursed artifacts once the ten-year mark has passed. Also, it seems as though Randall has finally found <a href="/wiki/index.php/1141:_Two_Years" title="1141: Two Years"> a less-gross name</a> for this anniversary than "biopsy-versary".

<dl><dd>I'm not sure why would counting this non-event as something good happening in 2020 made more sense than counting, for example, the 75th anniversary of end of World War II which happened in September.

<p>Its been 3 Years since 7 Years?! Damn, time sure does fly fast. Congratulations to Randall and his wife!
</p><p>I was so confused when I read the comic-until I realized it was based on a true story. This is very sweet of Randall to dedicate this comic to his wife's progress. -neverdroptop 04:37, 17 November 2020 (UTC)

</p><p>Damn, a new pandemic has arrived: it affects xkcd readers exclusively and adds little salty droplets near their eyes!
</p><p>Why does the transcript refer to her as just "Randall's fiancée?" We know her name is Megan.
Regardless, happy 10 years, and may you have many, many more. <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Duraludon" title="User:Duraludon">Duraludon</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Duraludon" title="User talk:Duraludon">talk</a>) 15:51, 17 November 2020 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Randall's wife is not called Megan, Megan is just something we call her, because he used that name a few times in the early comics for that character. In this comic Megan depicted Randall's wife, and thus it is not wrong to call her that in the transcript. Just like we call Cueball Randall in this comic, but not generally. --<a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Kynde" title="User:Kynde">Kynde</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Kynde" title="User talk:Kynde">talk</a>) 16:42, 17 November 2020 (UTC)

<dl><dd>I Googled "randall munroe wife" and the first result is an article <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://laughingsquid.com/xkcd-seven-years/#:~:text=In%20November%202010%2C%20Megan%2C%20then,of%20stage%20III%20breast%20cancer.">[2]</a> on laughingsquid.com about <a href="/wiki/index.php/Seven_Years" class="mw-redirect" title="Seven Years">Seven Years</a> which calls her Megan, but Randall's Wikipedia page doesn't mention her name at all.

<p>This one just makes me so, so happy. I was scared that it would be a sad comic, but was overjoyed upon reading. --<a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Char_Latte49" title="User:Char Latte49">Char_Latte49</a>
</p><p>The thing that struck me was what he said about "not and act of grace, but something I desperately wanted to do". And I thought, hm, isn't it both, and isn't that the best kind of grace? Grace may be undeserved, but it doesn't have to be grudgingly given&#160;:). --<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.74.89" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.74.89">162.158.74.89</a> 17:27, 17 November 2020 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>Grace is something you can give to someone if you want/have to make the other person feel better (in whatever degree and whatever "feel" may mean in context). It is thus per definition not an act of grace if your motive is just your own feelings ("<i>I</i> desperately wanted to do"). That his soon-to-be wife felt better with that act (otherwise she most likely wouldn't have agreed) is just some lucky coincidence. That sounds somewhat cold and isn't meant as such. My point is that something may look like an act of grace but isn't one. <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Elektrizikekswerk" title="User:Elektrizikekswerk">Elektrizikekswerk</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Elektrizikekswerk" title="User talk:Elektrizikekswerk">talk</a>) 11:17, 18 November 2020 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Grace is a direct referent to God (though you can use it another way, if an unbeliever). The notion of being saved is due to God's grace, an "unearned gift". You don't get it because you deserve it, you get it because God is generous. Even lacking the Judeo-Christian context, it still is used generally in a similar context -- a gift given by a generous spirit, not a gift deserved or earned. Randall rejects that notion, and says it was very much a gift he wished to share with her -- time together, whatever it wound up to be. And, in the end, that's all you can hope for, anyway. One of you can get hit by a bus tomorrow. --<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.187.247" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.187.247">162.158.187.247</a> 01:54, 24 November 2020 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>I have made a new series category, <a href="/wiki/index.php/Category:X_Years" title="Category:X Years">Category:X Years</a>, for these three comics. Should in principle have been done after number two, but better late than never. A beautiful series. --<a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Kynde" title="User:Kynde">Kynde</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Kynde" title="User talk:Kynde">talk</a>) 15:03, 18 November 2020 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>I tend to think the category is better called "N Years" rather than "X Years" since the number is not continuously variable, as <i>x</i> implies; <i>n</i> better suggests discrete numbers. Although I wonder if a more self-explanatory topic would be better, e.g. "N Years Cancer-free"? <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:JohnHawkinson" title="User:JohnHawkinson">JohnHawkinson</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:JohnHawkinson&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:JohnHawkinson (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 21:12, 24 November 2020 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>I adore that panel of them sitting by the river. I wish Randall would do "serious" art like that more often, he's clearly got talent. --<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Youforgotthisthing&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Youforgotthisthing (page does not exist)">Youforgotthisthing</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Youforgotthisthing&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Youforgotthisthing (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 19:30, 18 November 2020 (UTC)
</p><p>That frame of them walking up a mountain...is that related to comic 1190? Because it looks a bit like that. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.68.86.21" title="Special:Contributions/172.68.86.21">172.68.86.21</a> 22:12, 18 November 2020 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>Yes. Everything is related.</dd></dl>
<p>Um... while I love a good "citation needed" as much as the next person, I don't think there's any good reason why the Wikipedian Protestor should be mentioned here.
