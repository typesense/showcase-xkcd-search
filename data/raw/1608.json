To celebrate, here's a small game.\n\n[[A stick figure on a hoverboard can navigate around a field with platforms and barriers, reminiscent of a pinball machine, from top to bottom and left to right. Along the way it can collect coins, and then deposit them in a little terminal down at the center of the bottom. When you do, a message reads, \"You got X coins in Y seconds!\" and a secondary message depending on how well you did. \nX=0 \"You successfully avoided all the coins!\"\nX=1 \"It's a start.\"\nX=2-4 \"Not bad.\"\nX=5-9 \"Terrific!\"\nX=10-16 (No message.)\nX=17 \"You found all the coins! Great job!\"\n\nHowever, if you leave the bounds of the playing field in either direction, a message in large red letters will flash:\nRETURN TO THE PLAY AREA\n\nWhen you keep going, you discover a vast world with grassy fields, caverns, mountains, volcanoes, and buildings. There are many little vignettes hidden everywhere, along with more coins.]]\n{{Title text: Return to the play area}}", "alt": "Return to the play area", "img": "https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/", "title": "Hoverboard", "extra_parts": {"headerextra": "", "inset": "\n<div id=\"explore\"></div>\n<style>\n@font-face {\n  font-family: 'xkcd-Regular';\n  src: url('/fonts/xkcd-Regular.eot?') format('eot'), url('/fonts/xkcd-Regular.otf') format('opentype');\n}\n\n#explore {\n  position: relative;\n  width: 740px;\n  height: 700px;\n  border: 2px solid black;\n  font-family: xkcd-Regular;\n  margin: 0 auto;\n}\n\n#explore:focus {\n  box-shadow: 0 0 30px 3px #96a8c8;\n}\n \n</style>\n<script src=\"/1608/tigl.min.js\"></script>\n<script>\nhelloWorld(function(path) {\n  return '/1608/' + path\n})\n</script>"}, "day": "24"}
