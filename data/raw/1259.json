When males try to mate with them, they transfer pollen. \n\n[[The woman kneels next to a flower.]]\nWoman: This orchid - Ophrys Apifera - makes flowers, but no bees land on them because the bee it mimics went extinct long ago. \n\n[[The woman stands.]]\nWoman: Without its partner, the orchid has resorted to self-pollinating, a last-ditch genetic strategy that only delays the inevitable. Nothing of the bee remains, but we know it existed from the shape of this flower. \n\n[[They walk on past the flower.]]\nWoman: It's an idea of what the female bee looked like to the male bee... ... as interpreted by a plant.\nBeret guy: Wow, so...\n\n[[We see a full-colour painting of an orchid flower. It has purple-pink petals on a mottled grey background, along with the bee-like parts. It's quite a realistic painting.]]\n... the only memory of the bee is a painting by a dying flower. \n\n[[The flower is alone in a panel.]]\n\n[[Beret guy walks back on screen.]]\n\n[[Beret guy kneels down next to it.]]\nBeret guy: I'll remember your bee, orchid.
