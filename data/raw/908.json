I always thought \"The Cloud\" was a huge, amorphous network of servers somewhere.\nHat Man: Yeah, but everyone buys server time from everyone else. In the end, they're all getting it here.\n\n[[A close-up of Hat Man.]]\nMan (off-screen): How? You're on a \ncable\n modem.\nHat Man: There's a lot of caching.\n\n[[A close-up of the man, looking down at the tower at his feet.]]\nMan: Should the cord be stretched across the room like this?\nHat Man (off-screen): Of course. It has to reach the server, and the server is over there.\n\n[[The man turns back to the Hat Man, still sitting at the computer.]]\nMan: What if someone trips on it?\nHat Man: Who would want to do that? It sounds unpleasant.\nMan: Uh. Sometimes people do stuff by accident.\nHat Man: I don't think I know anybody like that.\n\n{{Title text: There's planned downtime every night when we turn on the Roomba and it runs over the cord.}}", "alt": "There's planned downtime every night when we turn on the Roomba and it runs over the cord.", "img": "https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/the_cloud.png", "title": "The Cloud", "day": "6"}
