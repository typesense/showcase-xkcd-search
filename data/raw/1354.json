There's a thought bubble arising from the server showing the data the server is currently processing, including a portion that states \"User Meg wants these six letters: POTATO.\"]]\nMeg: Server, are you still there? If so, reply \"POTATO\" (6 letters).\n\n[[The 6 letters \"POTATO\" are highlighted yellow in the server's thought bubble, and the server emits \"POTATO\".]]\n\n[[The phrase \"User Meg wants these 4 letters: BIRD.\" is in the server's thought bubble with other data around it, with \"BIRD\" highlighted. The server is emitting \"BIRD\".]]\nMeg: Hmm...\n\n[[The phrase \"User meg wants these 500 letters: HAT.\" is in the server's thought bubble, along with other data around it.]]\nMeg: Server, are you still there? IF so, reply \"HAT\" (500 letters).\n\n[[\"HAT\" and many more characters after it in the thought bubble are highlighted, and the server emits a long string of text starting with \"HAT\" but then including much more other unrelated data.
