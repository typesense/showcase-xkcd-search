<p>This is yet another comic designed to <a href="/wiki/index.php/Category:Comics_to_make_one_feel_old" title="Category:Comics to make one feel old">make people feel old</a>, following soon after the last one <a href="/wiki/index.php/1745:_Record_Scratch" title="1745: Record Scratch">1745: Record Scratch</a>. Not so long ago a comic with the very title of the largest bold letters in the caption above the panel was released: <a href="/wiki/index.php/1686:_Feel_Old" title="1686: Feel Old">1686: Feel Old</a>. The next comic about feeling old, was released 11 months later, with a similar title, which is special in itself, <a href="/wiki/index.php/1898:_October_2017" title="1898: October 2017">1898: October 2017</a> see more on both title and this follow up comic in the <a href="#Trivia">trivia</a> section below.
</p><p>Specifically this comic contains <i>The <b>November 2016</b> Guide to making people feel old</i>. (The  <a href="#Trivia">unusual title</a> for the comic indicates that it only works during this month). It lists ages between 16 and 41 and links each age to one or more events that happened approximately half that age ago, so 8 years ago for the 16 years old and 20 years ago for the 40 years old etc, which means that a person of that age would have had the mentioned thing in their life for the majority of their life. And then it explains that to make a person of a given [age] feel old, look up the [thing] (or things) connected to it, and say:    
</p>
<dl><dd>"Did you know [thing] has been around for the majority of your life?" </dd></dl>
<p>As an example the <b>age 21</b> can be used, as it list both the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Xbox 360">Xbox 360</a> as well as this comic, <a href="/wiki/index.php/xkcd" title="xkcd">xkcd</a> itself. The two possible sentences would then be:
</p>
<dl><dd>"Did you know that the Xbox 360 has been around for the majority of your life?" </dd>
<dd>"Did you know that xkcd has been around for the majority of your life?" </dd></dl>
<p>This matches earlier attempts to make people feel old by mentioning how long ago it was that, for instance, a movie comes out as was the case in <a href="/wiki/index.php/891:_Movie_Ages" title="891: Movie Ages">891: Movie Ages</a>. (But on this exact day when the comic was released there might have many people who did already feel old and tired - see <a href="#Trivia">trivia</a>). When an event seems to have occurred recently to you, like seeing a movie when you were twenty (with <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toy_Story" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Toy Story">Toy Story</a></i>) and then suddenly realizing that this was 21 years ago, you will very likely feel old. Since humans' perception of time is not related to how much time has actually passed but rather to important memories, then memories like seeing the first feature-length fully computer-animated movie (<i>Toy Story</i>) makes a big impression and may stay vivid in peoples' memories. When they then, after hearing the sentence from this comic, realize that more than half their life has passed since that event, they realize how much time has passed and that makes them feel old.
</p><p>This is why it affects a 20-year-old to hear that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Twitter">Twitter</a> is ten years old, where this will not have the same impact on a 16-year-old, since they were so young when it came out that they probably feel like it has been around for ever, and you do not feel old by hearing, for instance, something like that the TV was invented before you were born. It thus makes sense to pick something that happened almost midway through a person's life, because they then realize they are now double as old as when they first heard of Twitter. Of course also many ten years old would not have been active on Twitter when it was released, so it may not have that big an impact on those 20 years old today.
</p><p>The joke at the end is that people over 41 don't need anything to make them feel old, because they already feel old. He thus teases people above 41 years old by claiming they are old, although many people (above 40) would claim you are not old before you retire. This trick was also used to cap the above mentioned <a href="/wiki/index.php/891:_Movie_Ages" title="891: Movie Ages">891: Movie Ages</a> to 35 years old, stating anyone as older was already old. But that comic was also released five years ago, and now Randall is himself closing in on 35 at 32 years at the time of this comics release. So he pushed the limit 6 years further, probably for this reason. Now he no longer thinks people at 36 are too old to try to make them feel old.  It may be a coincidence, but still interesting, that he stopped the list just before 42, a number Randall has referred to many times in relation to it being the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Answer_to_the_Ultimate_Question_of_Life,_the_Universe,_and_Everything" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything">Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything</a>" in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy">Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</a>.
</p><p>The title text points out that the same chart can be used for the same person once they are twice as old. So it urges the user to note down the age of the person it was used on, and then wait until their age reaches double that. So for a 16-year-old that would only be 16 more years until they are 32, but for a 41-year-old it would have to wait until they are 82 years old. When showing them this chart, they will realize that this has existed for half of their life and again have the same type of "feeling old" that this comic is supposed to instigate today.(It will work better if they still remember the joke made on them those many years ago)...

<ul><li>Explanation of table:
<ul><li>Persons age as given in the comic.</li>
<li>Persons birth year. 2016 minus persons age.</li>
<li>Date of things. For instance a release date, the year that a thing began/happened or a year where it became a phenomenon (in the US that is, in case if was already a phenomenon somewhere else first).</li>
<li>Things as given in the comic. There can be more than one "thing" for each age, so it should be things in plural form.</li>
<li>Half age - Persons age divided by two, so either an integer or a half integer (10 or 10.5). This number should never be higher than the last column, which is also the case, when taking release dates into account.</li>
<li>Years ago - the number of years since the things became "a thing". In order for this thing to have been in a persons life for the majority of their life this need to be larger (or at least equal) than half that persons age. So this number should be larger than the column before. If there are more than one thing for a given age, the average year for these things are taken and used to calculate the number of years. This number should be given with a decimal, and not necessarily in half years. Only one of the entries are more than one year higher than the half age. This has been highlighted in <b>bold</b>.</li></ul></li></ul>

(Average release date for the two was October 25, 2005). The Xbox will work on the 21 year old person, similar to the reason the Wii above would work. xkcd would not as it is not a comic directed at 10-11 year old persons, who would thus not have any feelings towards that part. But it is also just included as a self-reference and to make faithful xkcd readers feel old. "Is it really more than 10 years ago I read it first..."

However, everyone today knows about Facebook, and to learn that it has existed half of your life may still make you feel old. The xkcd user may feel old learning that it is 12 years ago that it came into existence, and then this entrance would have fulfilled it's purpose anyway.

It is questionable how many kids of that age had used Wikipedia at the time when it was launched. Because at that time the number of articles was limited and it was not like today where 15 year old school children would use it to look up things. But of course realizing that before that time you had to use paper encyclopedias for all the thing you today look up on-line on Wikipedia may still make a 30 year old feel old. As will many xkcd readers regardless of age. "Is it only 15 years ago we could not use Wikipedia..."

<ul><li>The title of this comic is special, and the like has never been seen before. Months have been included in the titles before, and also years, but never like this with a month and a year.
<ul><li>But since then one more comic like this has been released, see below.</li></ul></li>
<li>Of course this also indicates that this comic only really work during November 2016.
<ul><li>Three earlier comics has used month names in the title, two with specific holliday dates, and one with the month as part of a rhyme:
<ul><li><a href="/wiki/index.php/656:_October_30th" title="656: October 30th">656: October 30th</a></li>
<li><a href="/wiki/index.php/680:_December_25th" title="680: December 25th">680: December 25th</a></li>
<li><a href="/wiki/index.php/1595:_30_Days_Hath_September" title="1595: 30 Days Hath September">1595: 30 Days Hath September</a></li></ul></li>
<li>And just a year has been used for time (including later comics):
<ul><li><a href="/wiki/index.php/998:_2012" title="998: 2012">998: 2012</a></li>
<li><a href="/wiki/index.php/1311:_2014" title="1311: 2014">1311: 2014</a></li>
<li><a href="/wiki/index.php/1624:_2016" title="1624: 2016">1624: 2016</a></li>
<li><a href="/wiki/index.php/1779:_2017" title="1779: 2017">1779: 2017</a></li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li>As a side note to the whole idea about feeling old, the chosen release day might not have been the most relevant to post such a comic. 
<ul><li>This comic was released just past midnight on the day that the result of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:2016 United States presidential election">2016 United States presidential election</a> was determined (i.e. the day after the election on November 8th 2016), so before anything was determined but likely at a time when the first polls showed which way it might end. </li>
<li>In the previous comic <a href="/wiki/index.php/1756:_I%27m_With_Her" title="1756: I&#39;m With Her">1756: I'm With Her</a>, from Monday the day before the election, Randall had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_endorsement" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Political endorsement">endorsed</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Hillary Clinton">Hillary Clinton</a> from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Democratic_Party" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:US Democratic Party">Democratic Party</a>. </li>
<li>Thus a 600 days election campaign finished on this day. It was a very controversial election and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Republican_Party" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:US Republican Party">Republican</a> nominee <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Donald Trump">Donald Trump</a> became <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President-elect_of_the_United_States" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:President-elect of the United States">President-elect of the United States</a> after winning the election. </li>
<li>This result had been feared to happen by half of the people of the United States, and the other half had feared that Clinton would win. And many people thus stayed up to follow the election all night. And now the whole thing is over, and the headache starts. </li>
<li>And on this day Randall tries to make people feel old... It seems likely he did not need to try so hard, as lots of people probably felt much older than their years after all this!</li></ul></li>
<li>Almost a year later Randall then released <a href="/wiki/index.php/1898:_October_2017" title="1898: October 2017">1898: October 2017</a>, the only second comic with this type of title.
<ul><li>This comic is also designed to make you feel old, thus continuing the trend of this comic.</li>
<li>But furthermore, in the title text, it references the election from the day before this comic came out, coming full circle on what might make you feel old. </li>
<li>Could be a reference to above mentioned discussion if it was really needed to make someone feel old on that particular day in November 2016, thus indirectly acknowledging people that had such objections.</li>
<li>This was also the first release of a comic to make one feel old since this one. Thus reminding people that a year has almost passed already, is in a way another way to make people feel old, if they remember this previous comic.</li></ul></li></ul>

<dl><dd> Spoiler alert: Trump won. --<a href="/wiki/index.php/User:JayRulesXKCD" title="User:JayRulesXKCD">JayRulesXKCD</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:JayRulesXKCD" title="User talk:JayRulesXKCD">talk</a>) 16:16, 9 November 2016 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>The main idea of the comic is stated in the first sentences "If they're [age], you say: "Did you know [thing] has been around for the majority of your life?"
The majority of your life means "more than half your life". For each of the age stated in the comic, something that happened more than half the age ago is stated.
As an example for the first two:
Grand Theft Auto IV was released in 2008, which is 8 years ago. More than 8 years is at the same time more than half of 16 years, which means "the majority of a 16 year old's life"
The next one goes for Rickrolling, which is "a prank and an Internet meme involving an unexpected appearance of the music video for the 1987 Rick Astley song 'Never Gonna Give You Up'. The meme is a type of bait and switch using a disguised hyperlink." according to <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickrolling">wikipedia</a>. Even if the first reference is from 2007, the same Wiki page says that 'By May 2008, the practice had spread beyond 4chan and became an Internet phenomenon'. May 2008 is more than 8 and a half years ago which is more than half of 17 years.
It goes on and on, with "Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters" which is a 2007 American Flash animated surreal comedy film", which again is more than 9 years ago and so on.
Sorry if I'm not clear enough but I hope you got it.

<dl><dd> Yeah, the "majority part" is a bit confusing. I looked up 35 and saw "The Matrix" and I was like "wait, that didn't come out 35 years ago?!". Well, it didn't and that's not what the comic implys. However, it has been around for a MAJORITY (= more than half) of my life. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.202.141" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.202.141">162.158.202.141</a> 12:37, 9 November 2016 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>I'm only 32, but saddened at the entry for 40. C&amp;H was (and still is) one of my favorites. I say we all just take off today and play some Calvinball.

</p><p>There is this last thing "over 41, we don't care" which I cannot really explain. Maybe the 40+ year olds seen all of these later in their life but why stop at this point? (which is around 1996, according to the "rules")? The internet has been around since way before that and if we take the first popular browser this was about 1993 or so. That would take us to 46. Is there any specific event which might be a reason to stop at 41? <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Anarhistu&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Anarhistu (page does not exist)">Anarhistu</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Anarhistu&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Anarhistu (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 13:12, 9 November 2016 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Sorry your are completely wrong. If you are 20 now and look at something happening 10 years ago. Then when you are twice as old (40) you look at the same ting and that will then be 30 years old. It will always be 10 years younger than you. There was a mistaken explanation of the title text saying something like what you say, and now I have corrected it. He just means that if you show them this chart again when their age has doubles, you can say that this chart has now existed in the majority of your life. --<a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Kynde" title="User:Kynde">Kynde</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Kynde" title="User talk:Kynde">talk</a>) 20:43, 9 November 2016 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>Heh.  Randall isn't always prompt in posting new comics early on M/W/F, but this one went up promptly at 12:01am.

<dl><dd>How the hell did you make out Clinton to be a communist? It's Trump who likes Putin, where Clinton would be more against him... I guess he just thought people needed something that could distract them from the election, since most of his readers (especially after his previous comic) would have rooted for Clinton because of their fear that Trump won. On the other hand most people probably feels old today, after the election, so in that way the comic is a bit of a waste... --<a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Kynde" title="User:Kynde">Kynde</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Kynde" title="User talk:Kynde">talk</a>) 20:43, 9 November 2016 (UTC)

<p>I don't understand how this is supposed to work. If I wanted to make someone feel old, I would pick an event that they think is fairly ancient and tell them: "do you realize you're *more* than twice as old as this?" Here, Randall does the opposite, he says: "did you know you're *less* than twice as old as this", so what? E.g. "Twitter has been around for a majority of your life" is true of anyone who is 0 to 20, so how is it supposed to make a 20-year-old feel old? Did Randall get his comic backwards or am I missing something?

<p>The explanation says "The titletext points out that the same chart can be used for the same person much later in their life. However, the major event shifts earlier and earlier into their life; when their age has doubled, the event in the chart has happend in the year of their birth."<br />This makes no mathematical sense - the major event would shift earlier <i>into their life</i>, but not <i>in time</i>, and would remain the same distance from their birth year. What is probably intended is that now <i>the chart itself</i> will be around for a majority of their life (though I agree with the above commenter that it would probably make one feel young, not old). --<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.68.10.90" title="Special:Contributions/172.68.10.90">172.68.10.90</a> 14:54, 9 November 2016 (UTC)

</p><p>Actually Randall may be wrong with some of those entries at the current moment. Let's say that somebody is 19 years old, but their 20th birthday is on the 10th of November. The entry for their age is the Nintendo Wii which came 9 years, 11 months and 20 days ago (as of November 9), which is not more than half of the subject's age. I think this occurs on quite a few of those entries, so either the chart is intended to be addressed only to people during their birthdays, or one can make fun of any geek who parades this list for not being rigorous with their maths. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.246.35" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.246.35">108.162.246.35</a> 15:38, 9 November 2016 (UTC)

<dl><dd> That's pretty pedantic. We're so close to the end of the year that we can reasonably assume it means "people who turned X years old in 2016" <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/141.101.98.165" title="Special:Contributions/141.101.98.165">141.101.98.165</a>
<dl><dd>I think he just goes for events that is approximately half as old as the person.

<dd>Pedantic? This is xkcd we're talking about. Not only that there's a post commenting on this comic's timing regarding the MWF pattern, as on every other similar comic, a fact that should be taken even less seriously, but Randall has greatly shown his support of pedants partly by repeatedly depicting them as empowered in his comics. I think that pedants have to either take responsibility for their demeanour or admit to the fact that their peculiarity does not even have the tradeoff of accuracy it should have. In other words, anyone who bothers others with a list like this better have precise information to offer if they expect to have any reason not to waste others' time. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.246.35" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.246.35">108.162.246.35</a> 05:25, 10 November 2016 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<p>Randall seems to be confused. If you think Twitter is young, then finding out that it's existed for a majority of your life would make you feel young. If you think Twitter is old, then of course it's been around for a majority of your life, it's old. 
</p><p>The right one would be: such-and-such has been around for less than 50% of your life.<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/141.101.98.112" title="Special:Contributions/141.101.98.112">141.101.98.112</a> 15:52, 3 April 2020 (UTC)
</p><p>Grand Theft Auto IV was merely "popular"?
It set the record for highest first-day earnings across all media types until The Dark Knight was released that summer.
Fun fact: The Dark Knight was added to the National Film Registry last year (2020), along with Shrek. As of that year, there are six 2000s theatrically-released movies on the registry (Memento, Shrek, Real Women Have Curves, Brokeback Mountain, The Dark Knight, and The Hurt Locker).
