<p>This comic shows a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_matrix" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Confusion matrix">confusion matrix</a> of the applicability of various household appliances to different tasks. Green indicates an excellent performance, yellow not ideal, but usable, and red dismal or destroyed. The diagonal is green as it shows the tasks done by the machines they are supposed to be performed by. See <a href="#Table">table</a> below. The comic is similar to <a href="/wiki/index.php/1890:_What_to_Bring" title="1890: What to Bring">1890: What to Bring</a>, but that comic does not use yellow or another intermediate color.
</p><p>Salmon can be easily <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dishwasher_salmon" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Dishwasher salmon">cooked in a dishwasher</a>, so it's marked "cooked", and thus "cook a frozen dinner" is only yellow on the dishwasher entry. 
</p><p>The stove/oven has three green as it can also cook a microwave frozen dinner, although slower, and can toast bread, again slower than the toaster. It is by far the machine that has fewest red entries, only one, as it cannot wash clothes. It can also not clean dishes, but it might sterilize them, thus that entry is yellow. It may actually dry the clothes, but is liable to burn them and is therefore yellow.
</p><p>The microwave oven can also cook eggs, thus it has two green, the only other than the stove/oven with more than one green.
</p><p>The toaster and the washing machines are the only ones without any yellow, and with only one green, for making toast/washing clothes - they are thus the appliances with least other potential uses (zero). The washing machine will at least not destroy the clothes if you try to dry it, but it has the opposite effect, thus still red. The toaster will not destroy the dishes, but will potentially just make the dirt burn harder to them.
</p><p>The title text mentions that it would be theoretically possible to cook eggs in a dryer, but it is not a common use for a dryer. <sup>&#91;<a href="/wiki/index.php/285:_Wikipedian_Protester" title="285: Wikipedian Protester"><i>citation needed</i></a>&#93;</sup> The joke is that it is not called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrambled_eggs" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Scrambled eggs">scrambled eggs</a> but tumbled eggs. It also mentions that the dryer has to become hotter than usual for a dryer (maybe dangerously hot for the clothes for it to work). And then the eggs should be cracked and put in a oven bag, that really needs to be tight and well zipped.

<td> Yes, a toaster's function is to make toast from bread.
</td>
<td> No. A dishwasher would likely turn bread into mush, and the result is unlikely to be edible.
</td>

</td>
<td> No. A washing machine would break the bread into several pieces, and is unlikely to be edible.
</td>
<td> Yes, toast can be made using a stove or an oven.

<th scope="row"> Wash dishes
</th>
<td> No. A toaster would not be able to wash dishes, and is likely to do nothing to make them clean.
</td>
<td> Yes, a dishwasher's function is to wash dishes.
</td>
<td> No. A microwave could heat up the dishes, but this would not serve any function in getting them clean, and could cause food to get even more stuck on the dishes.
</td>
<td> No. A washing machine would break the dishes. The pieces would be clean, but unusable as dishes.
</td>
<td> Maybe, a stove or an oven could theoretically sterilize dishes with high heat (but this would not clean off any stains or stuck food particles).
</td>
<td> No. Worse than the washing machine, the tumbling of a dryer would thoroughly pulverize porcelain dishes and then possibly melt the grains together due to high heat.

</td>
<td> Maybe. The fish could be cooked in a dishwasher, however the rest might not, but this is not a typical use of a dishwasher.
</td>
<td> Yes, a microwave is normally used to cook a frozen dinner.
</td>
<td> No. A washing machine would make the dinner soggy and inedible.

</td>
<td> Yes, a washing machine's function is to wash clothes.

<th scope="row"> Cook eggs
</th>
<td> No. A toaster would not be able to cook eggs. This image seems to show that eggs were cracked directly into the toaster, which causes a large plume of smoke.

</td>
<td> Maybe. A microwave could (unevenly) get clothes dry.
</td>
<td> No, a washing machine's function is to wash clothes and would just get the clothes wet. A washing machine's spin cycle could dry clothes to some extent, but is not intended to fully wring all the water out of clothes.
</td>

<dl><dd>[The comic is laid out like a grid, with usages for common household appliances the left-hand side (Make toast / Wash dishes / Cook a frozen dinner / Wash clothes / Cook eggs / Dry clothes) and appliances for these activities across the top (Toaster / Dishwasher / Microwave / Washing machine / Stove/oven / Dryer).

<p>A spin-drying program can usually be selected separately without getting the clothes wet. While this is not effective as a dryer, still much better than nothing.

<p>I microwave can boil eggs, you just nweed to wrap them in foil and ensure they are covered by the boiling water. The foil acts as a faraday cage and ensures they only cook by conduction from the outside and the water stops arcing. 
You cvan also make scrabled eggs and omlettes. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Arachrah&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Arachrah (page does not exist)">Arachrah</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Arachrah&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Arachrah (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 09:31, 4 February 2021 (UTC)

<dl><dd>yes, read what they said. The aluminium foil happens to be unnecessary because they are immersing the eggs in water which will eventually boil. A fun thing to do is say to put a half a cup of water in the microwave, and listen to the screams from people who don't know that a couple of halved grapes are just fine with that half cup of water. One year old microwaves may not need the water; the half cup of water thing is from the directions for use on a twenty year old microwave.

<dd> You can put a foil there IF you know what you are doing. Try dissecting a microwave popcorn bag - its bottom has an aluminium foil inside and acts as a pan. I was surprised by inclusion of egg as okay by Randall though - I thought egg yolks were famous for infrequent but nasty <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/dangers-microwaving-eggs/story?id=51630977">superheating surprises</a> when microwaved. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.165.116" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.165.116">162.158.165.116</a> 10:41, 4 February 2021 (UTC)

</p><p>I'm a bit weirded out by the idea that the eggs in the grid are specified as being poached. I'd have thought that "eggs in a microwave" meant scrambled, unless otherwise specified. And yes, OK, saying "poached" is specifying otherwise, you're right, thanks for mentioning it, but the implication is that poaching is <i>the</i> way that microwaves cook eggs. I've cooked a lot of eggs, microwave and otherwise, and today is the first day the idea of using a microwave to poach them has come up. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Yorkshire_Pudding&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Yorkshire Pudding (page does not exist)">Yorkshire Pudding</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Yorkshire_Pudding&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Yorkshire Pudding (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 00:59, 6 February 2021 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Oh man, I wonder whether Randall is aware of the difficulty his choice in colors creates for colorblind readers. He's done comics referring to colorblindness before, hasn't he? I wonder if a subtle edit should be in order, on his part. (Alternatively, a confusion map of which vision types perceive differences between which colors, labeled in the same problematic colors, might have a certain apropos irony...?) </dd>

<p>What a microwave does to bread is very weird. It seems to make the bread tougher (i.e., harder to bite through; in one case of a microwaved sandwich I was totally unable to bite off pieces), but doesn't make it stiffer (it ends up kind of like rubber). It doesn't wind up unevenly toasted like in the picture, but rather cooked in a completely different way. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Magic9mushroom&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Magic9mushroom (page does not exist)">Magic9mushroom</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Magic9mushroom&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Magic9mushroom (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 11:22, 4 February 2021 (UTC)

<p>I'm surprised how many people persist in using "bad" toasters (slot loading). They're terrible at handling pretty much everything except sliced bread, &amp; are completely impractical for more than half the things one might want "toasted". Even a sliced bagel turns out better in a half-decent "toaster oven" than in any slot-loader I've seen; &amp; with a toaster oven you can toast the toppings too. (For instance: peanut butter is better toasted! Warm gooey cream cheese! Reheat muffins with loads of butter on top!) Try making a toasted sandwich in a slot loader; they're a nightmare. Even cleaning them is more effort than a toaster oven. Slot loaders are terrible, obsolete fire hazards, as far as I'm concerned. Yet when you say "toaster", people still visualize a slot loader. It's like if you said "pencil" &amp; everyone visualized a stick of bare graphite. The graphite can <i>conditionally</i> be used for <i>some</i> purposes related to "pencil" but the wood cased design with rubber eraser is far more practical. Same situation with toasters; why use a slot-loader when you can get a <i>good</i> toaster instead?

</p><p>Our Miele dishwasher tits 65C during part of the washing cycle (not the drying part).  
</p><p>Classic sous vide egg poaching temperature is 64C so it should be able to poach an egg if you like your yolks runny.  It's also plenty hot enough to sous vide fish (as long as it is a relatively thin fillet).  Here I would be worried about overcooking white fish but firm fish like tuna or monkfish might work well.  I'll give it a go tonight and report back!
