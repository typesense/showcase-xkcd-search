<p>Two factor security authentication is a semi-recent (about 20-30 years old at least, but only used on popular websites since around  2011) development in security to make it harder to compromise accounts by requiring two disparate authentication forms to be used in tandem. A 'factor' has typically been described as either something you know (e.g. a password), something you have (perhaps a physical object) or something you are (fingerprint or other biometric measure), and two-/three-factor authentication might loosely be any two/three examples from any of these or else never more than one in any category.  
</p><p>These days, the definition is often satisfied via a second email address or phone (to receive texts), which might be considered a 'have' factor, to back up a password or PIN you know. Authentication programs like Okta and Google Authenticator being somewhat more secure and also pretty popular (and some sites include other approaches; for instance, many implementations of 2FA allows a method where are provided a number of alphanumeric secondary keys you can print out on paper, but each can only ever be used once), but early two factor authentication mostly made use of physical "keys" that would, most often, provide access to a periodically changing number that had to be entered along with your password.
</p><p>A password/code has usually been the one constant, whether biometrically accompanied or (perhaps more commonly, at times) supported by a possession of some kind. However Microsoft has recently touted "Passwordless logins", where either one or two non-'know' factors apparently entirely replace the trouble of setting and remembering a <a href="/wiki/index.php/936" class="mw-redirect" title="936">good password</a> for services they can control.
</p><p>In this strip, Cueball is discussing two factor security keys with Ponytail, telling her that he has finally buckled down and gotten the two factor security keys that she keeps pestering him to get. He goes through (panel 2) the trials that he endured in "installing" the key, all of which seem like plausible trials for setting up two-factor authentication properly.  However (in panel 3) it is then revealed that all his work was just the task of installing the key (which looks like several common brands of physical two-factor keys on the market (*)) onto his metal keyring.
</p><p>Metal keyrings are reliably secure as far as keeping a key attached <sup>&#91;<a href="/wiki/index.php/285:_Wikipedian_Protester" title="285: Wikipedian Protester"><i>citation needed</i></a>&#93;</sup>, but this is in part because of how notoriously difficult it is to add a key to or remove a key from. The rings must be forced apart and <i>held</i> apart while the key traverses however many layers the ring has (usually two or three, though keyrings with more layers are not unheard of). Cueball confidently asserts (to off-screen Ponytail, who from her response probably hasn't yet gotten the joke) that his key is <i>not</i> coming off, indicating both a (well-founded) faith in the keyring's ability to keep his key, and a desire to not go through the same process in reverse.  However, presumably, since all his effort was in "installing" the key onto his keychain, he probably hasn't actually set it up on any of his accounts, rendering them just as insecure as they were before he got a two factor key.
</p><p>The title text has a similar double meaning.  Cueball would of course use it to the "proof" of his efforts installing the key--though difficult, metal keyrings can be forced apart physically by human hands, at least if the human in question has fingernails sturdy enough to slip between the rings, at which point the insertion of a finger would be enough to keep it apart until the key is inserted. However, keeping the rings apart can be strenuous on the fingers, and can result in bruising, which Cueball is all too familiar with. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Proof of work">Proof of work</a> alludes to the cryptographic concept, which ties (sideways, as proof of work is a security term for a concept intended to deter denial of service and similar volume-based attacks but not directly related) back into the two-factor authentication.
</p><p>Additionally a third meaning could be that while he spend a lot of time setting up 2FA he totally overlooked the possibility of him losing his whole keychain thus locking him out of all the services that requires 2FA if he didn't set up yet another layer of backup.
</p><p>Worth noting is the not all that uncommon habit of keeping all of one's keys together in the same place, which allows a single point of entry for an attacker to obtain all of the victim's keys all at once.
</p><p>(*) Yes, 2FA does not necessarily mean using your phone, there is such a thing as a PHYSICAL separate 2FA.  In many security contexts it's preferable to compartmentalize your phone number from the rest of your account details, which can make them ideal in a number of circumstances.

</p>
<dl><dd><dl><dd> First thing that comes to mind when someone mentions a 2FA security key. 100% most certainly what they are talking about. yubikey/fido2 being the ones that popularized it iirc <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.69.71.177" title="Special:Contributions/172.69.71.177">172.69.71.177</a> 04:41, 30 September 2021 (UTC)</dd>
<dd> Yeah, yubikey definitely comes to mind. I wouldn't call 2FA on a phone a 2FA "Key". Perhaps you could call the generator secret a (cryptographic) key, but I don't think that's what this comic is talking about. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Jeffkmeng&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Jeffkmeng (page does not exist)">Jeffkmeng</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Jeffkmeng&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Jeffkmeng (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 06:56, 30 September 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>2FA tokens are actually quite often physical keys that fit on a keychain and produce a secret number to input for authentication. It is only recently that such 2FA key generators have moved into phones. Here is one example: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_SecurID">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_SecurID</a>
<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Adron1111&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Adron1111 (page does not exist)">Adron1111</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Adron1111&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Adron1111 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 06:41, 30 September 2021 (UTC)
</p><p>The joke here isn't 2FA key vs tumbler-and-pin key, the joke is that all of the configuration pain he's talking about isn't setting up the key to work with his computer or various sites (which one might expect when introducing a new, non-tech-savvy user to 2FA), but rather getting the key onto his keyring.  <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.69.34.67" title="Special:Contributions/172.69.34.67">172.69.34.67</a> 07:22, 30 September 2021 (UTC)
</p><p>Haven't put this in the text (I added some practical "what you know/have/are" stuff, from my own past experience) but I first thought it was that two <i>actual</i> factors are now on the keyring (insecurely, as per the current last para?). A 'have' item is obviously there, of whatever form, but now (unless it's a second 'have', supposed to be separate) there is also somehow a 'know' one (c.f. those people who have scrawled their bank-card PINs onto their bank-cards, entirely negating that particular safety-factor) or an 'are' one (bits of fingerprint? blood samples?). Possibly now imposssible to use (if not trivially easy to co-steal). Plus, remember that data security has two faces: 1) Only those authorised may access/change data; 2) Those who are authorised should not be deprived of this ability. It is commonly the second that require a second factor (separate email/phone contact) to get around problems with the first (forgotten password), though it isn't really an everyday 2FA application, just a backup 1FA method (as with "Name of first pet", etc). <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.70.34.191" title="Special:Contributions/172.70.34.191">172.70.34.191</a> 10:14, 30 September 2021 (UTC)
</p><p>My immidiate take was that Ponytail was being sarcastic . . . . <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.70.130.209" title="Special:Contributions/172.70.130.209">172.70.130.209</a> 10:53, 30 September 2021 (UTC)
</p><p>wow you guys finished the explanation already? nice
</p><p>This explanation needs a link to the Wikipedia entry for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_token" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Security token">Security token</a>, because that is clearly what Cueball is putting on his keyring here. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/162.158.203.24" title="Special:Contributions/162.158.203.24">162.158.203.24</a> 14:14, 30 September 2021 (UTC)
