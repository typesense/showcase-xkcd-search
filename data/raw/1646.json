A group of other people are in the background behind them.]]\nHost: Welcome to Stargazing, with your host, me.

Honestly half of 'em just look like dots.\n\n((Normal color panel - black on white))\n[[A shot from far away of the host standing in the center of the group of people watching her, she points to the sky.]]\nHost: This is Sirius.
