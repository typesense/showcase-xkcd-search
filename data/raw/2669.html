<p>This comic references various questions submitted by people and used in the <a href="/wiki/index.php/what_if%3F_(blog)" title="what if? (blog)"><i>what if?</i> blog</a> and the <i><a href="/wiki/index.php/What_If%3F_(book)" title="What If? (book)">What If?</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/index.php/What_If%3F_2" title="What If? 2">What If? 2</a></i> books. In particular, promoting <a href="/wiki/index.php/Randall" class="mw-redirect" title="Randall">Randall</a>'s new book, <i>What if? 2</i> (released 6 days after the date of this comic publication). This comic has a list of things not to do, an extension of a previous list, and is purportedly things Randall discovered as he was doing research for his book.  A visit to the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://what-if.xkcd.com/archive/">What If? archive</a> shows the titles, publishing date, and a thumbnail for each article.  Many of the acts described under the "new" section of the list are depicted in these thumbnails (see table below); others are references to examples or hypotheticals explored within the articles. The entries are all in order of their appearance in the book.  
</p><p>The title text says that Randall is tempted to tell people that all the things in the book were things that he actually tried to do, not that he calculated the solutions for their problems. Many of the questions and answers in his new book are impossible to attempt in real life.<sup>&#91;<a href="/wiki/index.php/285:_Wikipedian_Protester" title="285: Wikipedian Protester"><i>citation needed</i></a>&#93;</sup>

<td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumption_of_Tide_Pods" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Consumption of Tide Pods">Tide Pods</a> are a brand of laundry detergent sold in small packets ("pods") of water-soluble gel. Many children have tried to eat them, thinking them to be candy, and have had to go to the hospital to treat poisoning. In 2017 and 2018, a satirical "challenge" originated around eating Tide Pods.

<td>Walk on stilts in a thunderstorm

Putting actual lava inside a regular lava lamp would most likely cause the lamp to melt and the glass to shatter, not to mention handling lava is very dangerous.<sup>&#91;<a href="/wiki/index.php/285:_Wikipedian_Protester" title="285: Wikipedian Protester"><i>citation needed</i></a>&#93;</sup> However, in this entry, Randall says it would be fairly easy to find a material that would be able to handle the heat of the lava and thus this would be rather anticlimactic.

<td>Eating meat from rabid animals could give you <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabies" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Rabies">rabies</a>, a virus which is nearly always fatal if not treated prior to the appearance of initial symptoms. Pathogen contamination in cooked foods can persist on the surface of <i>e.g.</i> tongs, chopsticks, or a fork used to grill, which is why the USDA doesn't generally allow kitchen utensils to touch raw or ready to eat foods at all. Exceptions for utensils which touch only raw or partially cooked foods, such as grill spatulas and the like, are often allowed and can be negotiated on a case-by-case basis when they would otherwise be prohibited. The rabies virus permeates essentially all nerve tissue before symptoms appear.

Actually doing this, even to county level regulators, could result in a series of events very disadvantageous to you, your farm, and your employees. However, declaring that you're producing Pokémon eggs to your local municipality is probably harmless, and likely to brighten the day of your local regulators.<sup>&#91;<a href="/wiki/index.php/285:_Wikipedian_Protester" title="285: Wikipedian Protester"><i>citation needed</i></a>&#93;</sup> Furthermore, as mentioned in <i>What If? 2</i>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://california.public.law/codes/ca_food_and_agric_code_section_27637">California Food and Agricultural Code § 27637</a> bars anyone from making false or misleading statements about eggs, and Poké Balls could be considered a type of egg.

When exposed to the plasma of the coronal surface or the Sun's interior, it would quickly ionize along with anything inside it, becoming plasma like the rest of the Sun.

<dl><dd>Maybe. But I don't think it will be.</dd>
<dd>What I was thinking was that there are clearly, on average, around 43  items per 'page', up to this point. This page shows only 19 items (both pre-New and New, or 20 if the "New" line counts as one, don't know if multilines reduce the number of numbered items ler page), so either it's been<sup>&#91;<a href="/wiki/index.php/285:_Wikipedian_Protester" title="285: Wikipedian Protester"><i>citation needed</i></a>&#93;</sup> manually split/new-paged (for changing aesthetics) or else it is highly varying according to the font-height/multiline-wrappings in use beforehand. Or perhaps we should expect around the same number of 'newer New' items to complete this page before the next page number is automatically started to be populated. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/172.70.86.8" title="Special:Contributions/172.70.86.8">172.70.86.8</a> 20:53, 7 September 2022 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>#156,819 looks like a reference to the Phineas and Ferb title sequence, and the episode Oil on Candace and probably more relevant here, What If 84. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/108.162.210.233" title="Special:Contributions/108.162.210.233">108.162.210.233</a> 21:49, 7 September 2022 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>It's true that it could be a reference, but I think I recognized most of the topics on the list as being mentioned in some what-if article from the archives--in the case of the "painting" one, <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://what-if.xkcd.com/84/">https://what-if.xkcd.com/84/</a>.  <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Dextrous_Fred" title="User:Dextrous Fred">Dextrous Fred</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Dextrous_Fred&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Dextrous Fred (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 22:13, 7 September 2022 (UTC)
<dl><dd>I think that given that he learned about this doing his new book that has not been released yet most of the new items would first be clear when we read the book, and hence all references to old what if seems moot to me... In my opinion it seems that those writing the current explanation failed to read this sentence: <i>Updates to my "Things You Should Not Do" list, based on what I learned writing What If? 2</i>!!! Taking this into acount nothing on the new list should be from the old what if blog/book. --<a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Kynde" title="User:Kynde">Kynde</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Kynde" title="User talk:Kynde">talk</a>) 13:02, 8 September 2022 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Many articles (roughly half) in the blog were published after the first book was written, so those references are fair game to be included in the new book, and thus valid references as things he learned in the interim.

Any indication what the purpose of the misspelling of <i>hemorrhagic</i> as <i>*hemorraghic</i> might be?

<dl><dd>We need a more practical approach to legal advice. For example, how realistically could there ever be any compensatory damages?

<p>I believe this may actually be a tf2 reference. In "Meet The Medic", a short animation made by valve, the medic implies he removed someone's bones without killing them, resulting in the loss of his medical license.
