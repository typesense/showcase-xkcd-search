<p><a href="/wiki/index.php/Megan" title="Megan">Megan</a> notices that an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Service_Provider" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Internet Service Provider">Internet Service Provider</a> (ISP) is blocking access to some webpages. <a href="/wiki/index.php/Cueball" title="Cueball">Cueball</a> is thankful that cryptography offers a way around such censorship. 
</p><p>Encryption, the study and use of which is known as "cryptography," or "crypto" for short, is the art of transmitting messages that can only be read by the intended receiver(s) by using mathematical techniques to conceal ("encrypt") the data in the message. One common and effective way to encrypt messages is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(algorithm)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:RSA (algorithm)">RSA algorithm</a>, which is based on the difficulty of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_factorization" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Integer factorization">integer factorization</a> for products of two prime numbers.
</p><p>Being able to share unbreakable codes and decrypt other people's codes gives countries a military advantage - for example, in World War II, the Americans and British were often able to figure out where a German attack would be coming and send reinforcements there, because they had cracked the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Enigma machine">German codes</a>. Because of this, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Export_of_cryptography_from_the_United_States" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Export of cryptography from the United States">United States government initially tried to keep</a> the mathematical details of strong encryption algorithms (including RSA) inside the country by classifying the algorithms as a weapon. It is a crime to share certain kinds of weapons technology with other countries without permission. Amateur and professional cryptographers, angry about the attempt to restrict their work, lobbied the government to change the rule and stop treating cryptography as a weapon, in part so that they could continue to collaborate with colleagues overseas, and in part because they wanted the ability to pass secret messages that the government could not easily decrypt. The export restrictions were gradually loosened and would have mostly been lifted by the year 2000.
</p><p>In the comic, <a href="/wiki/index.php/Megan" title="Megan">Megan</a> makes the provocative and counter-intuitive point that perhaps the cryptographic community could have best ensured easy access to the RSA technique by *allowing* the government to treat RSA as a weapon, and then, once everyone is certain that RSA is a weapon, invoking the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Second Amendment to the United States Constitution">Second Amendment to the United States Constitution</a>, commonly known as the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_keep_and_bear_arms_in_the_United_States" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Right to keep and bear arms in the United States">right to bear arms</a>" amendment (that is, the right to own and use weapons). In other words, if RSA were a weapon, it would be granted constitutional protections. 
</p><p>This interpretation is likely a reference to the exceptionally strong antipathy towards arms control in the Southern United States (and not a whole lot weaker in most areas of the Northern and Western states).  Any attempts made by the government to restrict distribution or ownership of firearms (even those very similar to military-grade weapons) are typically countered by aggressive opposition from pro-gun rights groups such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Rifle_Association" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:National Rifle Association">National Rifle Association</a>. These political forces have made most gun restrictions politically untenable in the United States.  Megan is likely suggesting that classifying RSA as a weapon would gain the crypto community very powerful and unlikely political allies; on the flip side, if the government had already ruled it a weapon that needed to be restricted for national security purposes, it could easily invoke the same clauses that allow it to restrict actual military-grade hardware such as automatic weapons, explosives, and chemical or biological weapons). Megan may also be hinting that, in the future, the US government might try to restrict access to encryption algorithms, making it necessary for cryptographers to defend their rights to them.
</p><p><a href="/wiki/index.php/Cueball" title="Cueball">Cueball</a> is surprised and impressed by this point, and pauses to contemplate Megan's strategy.
</p><p>The title text claims that this is a reasonable interpretation of the Constitution, because cryptography (a modern weapon) is analogous to muskets and cannons (the weaponry in use in the 1780s, when the Second Amendment was drafted). As evidence for the analogy, the title text points out that Jefferson would have been a big fan of cryptography, which is plausible, because President <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Thomas Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a> (the 3rd President of the United States) was an amateur scientist who enjoyed studying a very wide variety of fields (in fact, he invented the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_disk" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Jefferson disk">Jefferson disk</a>, an encryption device that was quite advanced for its time). The point is somewhat facetious, because it is hard to imagine a modern technique that Jefferson would <i>not</i> "be totally into." Also, the mere assertion that an early President would have been a fan of a technique is not very good evidence that the technique would be legally permitted by a particular Amendment.

<p>While RSA is mentioned as a cryptographic mechanism whose "munitions" status was fought over, yours truly considers the whole of PGP's fight (and its original <i>1st</i> Amendment idea to get around the restrictions) as the archetype of this kind of export battle.  Never did get me one of the alleged T-shirts with the souce-code printed on, that were supposed to be going around in 1991-ish, though...
</p><p>So, anyway, that's something using the 1st Amendment, something using the 2nd Amendment...  So how can we theoretically fight the issue via the right not to have soldiers quartered in one's home?&#160;;)  <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/178.107.63.150" title="Special:Contributions/178.107.63.150">178.107.63.150</a> 23:39, 5 June 2013 (UTC)
</p><p>Every time I see the 2nd Amendment in text... that one comma. That first comma doesn't belong. I think they were trying to write, "A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, <i>will always have the right to bear arms</i>" but then they got distracted or changed their mind and just forgot that the comma was there. I'm not usually that much of a grammar nazi, but that's the freaking <i>Constitution!</i>  --<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/69.211.56.17" title="Special:Contributions/69.211.56.17">69.211.56.17</a> 22:41, 10 October 2013 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>I do admit that the wording would be clearer <i>today</i>, but that is a faulty argument here, for two reasons. First, It was written more than 200 years ago, almost 240, in fact. Unless you have a contemporary grammar, you have no right to be a grammar Nazi with the Constitution. Second, The Constitution was deliberately constructed to be vague, so it might last a little longer than the ten years predicted for it.

<p>I still don't quite understand this comic. If crypto is classified as a weapon, then people in the USA are free to use it? Why would they not be free to use it today? What does (politicians'?) complacency have to do with all of this?
</p><p>(On second thought, is this comic referring to the continued attempts of outlawing cryptography? e.g. <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-30778424">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-30778424</a> ) --<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/141.101.80.111" title="Special:Contributions/141.101.80.111">141.101.80.111</a> 09:51, 15 January 2015 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>As it says in the comic, the encryption technique was originally classed as a weapon in order to make it illegal to export the technology to other countries. Controlling the use of encryption within the US was going to be difficult due to the First Amendment, but preventing other countries accessing the US developed technology was seen as the most important goal. See <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Export_of_cryptography_from_the_United_States">here</a> for more detailed explanation. The comic definately addresses the ongoing legal status of encryption technology, but as far any link to Mr Camerons recently reported attacks on encryption, this comic was published in 2008, so no.  <small> -- <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Pudder" title="User:Pudder">Pudder</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Pudder" title="User talk:Pudder">talk</a>)  <span style="color:grey; white-space:nowrap;"><i>(please sign your comments with ~~~~)</i></span></small></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd> Cameron's was just an example; the attacks have been going on for twenty years, and in most western countries.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd> Anyway, I'm quite aware of US embargoes, but the the right-to-bear-arms amendment doesn't apply to them. I'm still finding the last panel incomprehensible. (I don't mean to pick on you specifically, but) none of my questions have been answered. --<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/141.101.80.111" title="Special:Contributions/141.101.80.111">141.101.80.111</a> 11:07, 15 January 2015 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd> After re-reading your comment and the comic, I think I understand where you are coming from. With encryption classed as a weapon, it cannot be exported, but may be used by citizens within the US. Once no longer classified as a weapon, it can still be used by citizens (i.e. nothing has changed as far as use by US citizens is concerned). The issue comes when if the government tries to prevent use of encryption; if classed as a weapon, you can use the "2nd amendment" defence. My guess on the complacency thing is that possibly politicians become complacent in believing that they have the power to 'control' encryption, and may deny use of it if they wanted. Classed as a weapon, suddenly the constitution stands in their way... Which would bring us back to 'outlawing encryption', though Mr Cameron and the UK in general would be another kettle of fish. Its a good question.--<a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Pudder" title="User:Pudder">Pudder</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Pudder" title="User talk:Pudder">talk</a>) 13:07, 15 January 2015 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Re: outlawing cryptography. Governments, including the US one, haven't liked encryption for a long while, as its use will make obtaining evidence much harder if not impossible. The recent talks have been about just outright outlawing it or otherwise weakening it to the point of irrelevance. See for example the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipper_chip">clipper chip</a> from 1993, which has a back door specifically built for law enforcement. See also various <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_disclosure_law">key disclosure laws</a>.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> But this might be irrelevant. I'm looking at this from a too modern angle; few of those laws existed in the 1990s, which is what the comic is referring to.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> I think the explanation is missing Megan's point and its effects for the rest of the world; the course of action which she proposes affects the United States alone. And of course, as I've mentioned, I feel that the final panel is halfway unaccounted for in the explanation. --<a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/141.101.80.111" title="Special:Contributions/141.101.80.111">141.101.80.111</a> 10:16, 16 January 2015 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>Does the freedom to speak not also include the freedom to speak privately?
You don't HAVE to harbour government agents in your home in the USA do you?
