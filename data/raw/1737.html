<p>This comic expands, to the limit, the strategy that it's a net cost saving to allow cheap hardware to fail and simply replace it than to have robust but much more expensive systems to start with. The technique was made famous by <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://books.google.com/books?id=zdlZ2rrcZWEC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;lpg=PA19#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Google circa 1999,</a> when its successful cost-effective server designs were actually using sub-consumer, nearly junk, hardware. 
</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAID" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:RAID">RAID</a> ("redundant array of independent disks") is a technology that splits data across several hard drives as if they were one. RAID comes in several levels (varieties) which have different applications, but one of the big applications of RAID is creating mirrored hard disks that back each other up. If one disk drive in such a RAID fails, no data is lost.
</p><p>However, RAID is complicated to configure, so you don't want to be constantly setting it up. An alternative technique for data centers is, therefore, to simply send the data to several servers at once. This makes maintenance easier, but without RAID, one hard disk crash basically breaks the server. However, this is what the woman with a bun's (possibly an adult <a href="/wiki/index.php/Science_Girl" title="Science Girl">Science Girl</a>) data center is doing since their scale is so large that fixing individual servers actually more expensive than simply buying a new one for replacement, and instead of fixing the drive they throw away the machine. (More about this approach will be explained later on)
</p><p>From here, the comic starts to exaggerate. Nowadays, servers can be made extremely small ("<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade_server" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Blade server">Blade servers</a>") and dozens of servers can be attached to one <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/19-inch_rack" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:19-inch rack">19-inch rack</a> in a data center. Rather than going to the effort of unplugging and unscrewing one blade from the rack, when a blade fails at <a href="/wiki/index.php/Cueball" title="Cueball">Cueball</a>'s data center they just throw away the rack, and <a href="/wiki/index.php/Ponytail" title="Ponytail">Ponytail</a> agrees and mildly mocks the woman with a bun for replacing one server.
</p><p><a href="/wiki/index.php/Hairy" title="Hairy">Hairy</a>'s data center goes one step further - they have so many servers that they would constantly have to be throwing away and replacing racks, so instead they just build a new room when one rack fails. This would be currently possible with small modular data centers that are built in shipping containers for easy transport and can be linked together to expand capacity.  Here the cargo-container "room" with the failure would be quickly swapped with a fresh one.  Cueball adds "like Google!" - <a href="/wiki/index.php/Randall" class="mw-redirect" title="Randall">Randall</a> previously mentioned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Google">Google's</a> approach to hard drive failures in the <a href="/wiki/index.php/what_if%3F" class="mw-redirect" title="what if?">what if?</a> <i><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://what-if.xkcd.com/63">Google's Datacenters on Punch Cards</a></i>. Back in <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/de//archive/disk_failures.pdf">2007</a> they had one failure every few minutes, which might have increased hugely since then.
</p><p>Finally <a href="/wiki/index.php/Megan" title="Megan">Megan</a> appears and her company, of course, breaks the scale of silliness in exaggeration. She says that they don't have any fire extinguishers (neither <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_sprinkler_system" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Fire sprinkler system">regular sprinklers</a> nor the systems that deploy gasses like FM-200 which alter the room air's ability to sustain a fire). Rather, they just rope the center off, thus letting the data center burn down. Then they simply move a town over and build a new one. This may indicate they are so big that the entire town will burn down if their center catches fire, for else they did not have to skip town. Alternatively, they just leave the center burning and this may cause problems in that town, so they simply flee the premises. 
</p><p>Most big internet companies do have multiple redundant data centers around the world, in order to increase speeds for users in different countries, but Megan's idea would be very expensive, result in increased <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latency_(engineering)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Latency (engineering)">latency</a>, possibly kill people (either in their company, or other people in the town and since they do not try to put out the fire), and cause severe destruction of properties in addition to their own.  These last two items would result in additional litigation and fines, and potentially jail sentences for the people charged with implementing the policy.  They may also result in other towns being unwilling to take their business, out of fear they will wind up burning too.
</p><p>Hairy still thinks that it makes sense, while Cueball wonders what difference the roping off does. This could again be a reference to the fact that they just let the buildings burn without bothering about the local consequences, and the next step is just one more step towards the extreme of the title text. 
</p><p>This comic references how, as data requirements expand, the cost of time eventually outweighs the cost of hardware at ever increasing scales (drive, rack, room, building). While this comic takes this to the extreme, with whole buildings being destroyed for simple flaws, the concept is not as far-fetched as it seems if "thrown out" is taken to include being sold to equipment refurbishers.  It could indeed be cost effective for a large data services provider to resell racks or even whole data center modules at some significant fraction of their "as new" price as opposed expending the time and effort to attempt a repair.  The equipment refurbisher would then rely on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_advantage" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Competitive advantage">cost advantage</a> like cheaper labor to repair the flaw and sell it back to Google or another company with less demanding requirements.  Equipment rental firms already operate on this model and with the added incentive customers preferring to rent newer models, this means that the equipment is often <i>preemptively</i> replaced before failures even occur.  
</p><p>The title text refers to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Isaac Asimov">Isaac Asimov</a>'s science-fiction short story <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Question" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:The Last Question">The Last Question</a></i> (<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://imgur.com/gallery/9KWrH">comic version</a>), where humanity asks, at different stages of its spatial and technological development, the same question to increasingly advanced computers: "How can the net amount of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Entropy">entropy</a> of the universe be massively decreased?". At each point, the computer's answer is that it does not yet have sufficient data for a meaningful answer. Ultimately, the computers are all linked through hyperspace, outside the physical boundaries of the universe, and make up a single computing entity named AC which keeps pondering the question even as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_death_of_the_universe" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Heat death of the universe">heat death of the universe</a> occurs and time and space cease to exist. When AC finally discovers the answer, since there is nobody left to report it to, it decides to demonstrate it and says "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let_there_be_light" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Let there be light">LET THERE BE LIGHT!</a>", which are the first words said by God during the Creation, according to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Genesis" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Book of Genesis">Book of Genesis</a>. Here, the title text implies that, as the universe died, AC no longer had a use for it as a physical support and, taking the comic's logic to the next extreme, chose to discard it and get a brand-new one instead of bothering to "fix" it by reversing its entropy. This short story was also referenced in <a href="/wiki/index.php/1448:_Question" title="1448: Question">1448: Question</a>.
</p><p>This comic's concept of taking a real world phenomenon and exaggerating it to levels currently considered implausible for comic effect closely mimics an earlier comic which describes progressively more "hardcore" programmers in <a href="/wiki/index.php/378:_Real_Programmers" title="378: Real Programmers">378: Real Programmers</a>. This comic might be related to <a href="/wiki/index.php/1567:_Kitchen_Tips" title="1567: Kitchen Tips">1567: Kitchen Tips</a> which suggests not throwing away your dishes but washing them.

<p>While the comic is obviously exaggerating, there are situations where this could make a certain amount of sense.   IF you can design a server so that most or all of the components reach end-of-life at about the same time,  then if a hard drive fails on one server, every other component of that server is likely to fail soon as well.
</p><p>If you install entire server racks or server rooms at the same time, where every machine contains components with the same basic life cycle...
</p><p>then in theory, once the first component fails, you can ignore it until mass component failures causes the entire rack/room to fall below a certain readiness level.
</p><p>At that point, there's no reason to pay a technician to spend several days removing and replacing half the individual components throughout that rack/room, when the other half are just going to fail in the next few months anyway.  In theory, it might be economically more efficient just to scrap everything at once, bring in brand-new server replacements, and re-sync the needed data from a networked backup. 
</p><p>in real life, it's very hard to build a server that will reliably degrade on schedule.... but with the right tradeoffs, and enough long-term performance data, it might eventually become possible to do so.

<dl><dd>Agree it fits with her style and she has appeared as an adult before. She also seems smaller than the other people so it could indicate she is still young.

<dl><dd><dl><dd>It's clearly not <a href="/wiki/index.php/Science_Girl" title="Science Girl">Science Girl</a>, because, as the linked page says "She became the first child to have its own character category.

There are plenty of other instances of "child" characters being seen as young adults - and of people acting out of character when "bit parts" are needed in cartoons.

<dl><dt>No need to invoke blade servers</dt></dl>
<p>There's no need to refer to blade servers in the explanation. You can fit many "normal" servers into a 19 inch rack. It could just say:
</p>
<dl><dd> From here, the comic starts to exaggerate. Many servers can be mounted in one 19-inch rack in a data center. Rather than going to the effort of unplugging and unscrewing one server from the rack, when a disk fails at Cueball's data center they just throw away the rack, and Ponytail agrees and kinda mock the woman with a bun for replacing a single server. </dd></dl>

<dl><dt>RAID is not complicated</dt></dl>
<p>Simple RAID 1 is not complicated to configure, unless you have some exotic HW RAID controllers. RAID 5 would be more complicated AND requires to be HW, but RAID 1 will usually be simple as HW OR possible to do SW completely automatically. What is costly is to replace discs as they fail, because it must be done by human&#160;; in bigger systems, it makes more sense to start with RAID 1, then when one disc fail simply ignore it - not repair nor throw it off, just let it operate without the RAID. -- <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Hkmaly" title="User:Hkmaly">Hkmaly</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Hkmaly" title="User talk:Hkmaly">talk</a>) 15:41, 23 September 2016 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd><dl><dd> Actually, depending on OS and software other RAID levels can be done in software, too. I've done RAID levels 5 and 6 fully in software using mdraid on Linux. Neither of them are really that much more complicated than RAID-1. ZFS can do even more complicated "RAID" types fully in software, too. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Iguanabob&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Iguanabob (page does not exist)">Iguanabob</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Iguanabob&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Iguanabob (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 16:55, 23 September 2016 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Gas-based data center fire extinguishers are not lethal</dt></dl>
<p>There's an explanation in this article which claims that gas-based data center fire suppression systems are lethal to anyone in the room when they are deployed.  This is a myth, based on some very ancient systems which used halon.  For decades now, agents like FM-200 have been used, which alter the air's ability to sustain a fire without removing oxygen from the room.  See this video  [ <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/-ub8gwgcOns">https://youtu.be/-ub8gwgcOns</a> ] for an example.  The camera crew is IN THE ROOM when the system is deployed.  Trust me on this, I've worked in data centers for 20 years and know this stuff inside and out. <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:IGnatius_T_Foobar&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:IGnatius T Foobar (page does not exist)">IGnatius T Foobar</a> (<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:IGnatius_T_Foobar&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:IGnatius T Foobar (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 16:17, 25 September 2016 (UTC)
