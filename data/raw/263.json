Inside, two teachers are talking.]]\nTeacher 1: My students drew me into another political argument.\nTeacher 2: Eh; it happens.\nTeacher 1: Lately, political debates bother me. They just show how good smart people are at rationalizing.\n[[The two teachers continue talking. A third one is seen reading a book on a sofa.]]\nTeacher 1: The world is so complicated - the more I learn, the less clear anything gets. There are too many ideas and arguments to pick and choose from. How can I trust myself to know the truth about anything?\nAnd if everything I know is so shaky, what on Earth am I doing teaching?\nTeacher 2: I guess you just do your best.
