Die Hard was nothing BUT action!\nMan: No, it was too talky.\nWoman: What? Too talky?\nMan: I tallied it minute-by-minute. It's at least 60% people walking and talking. ALL those movies are.\nMan: Just once, I want a real action movie. 30 seconds of exposition followed by a perfect 90-minute action scene. One with a huge budget, a good choreographer, and a great director.\nWoman: And they should center it around some character we already know, someone we never get tired of watching.\nMan: I think we've got something here...\n[[A movie poster is shown]]\nMovie Poster: Coming this summer\nMovie Poster: River Tam\nMovie Poster: Beats up EVERYONE\n[[The movie shows a line of houses, there are people beat up and lying in doorways, out of windows, and on the sidewalk. River Tam is doing a flying kick into someone's face]]\n{{title text: By my count, only 48 of the 158 minutes in Live Free or Die Hard have action.  That's pathetic, guys.
