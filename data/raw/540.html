<p>This comic comes in two parts and is a pun on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_metaphors_for_sex" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Baseball metaphors for sex">baseball metaphor</a> used to describe how far a date went regarding erotic actions. Many different versions of the baseball metaphor exist, with varying degrees of complexity. But it has rarely been described with as many details as the one drawn by <a href="/wiki/index.php/Randall" class="mw-redirect" title="Randall">Randall</a> in this comic.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="First_part_-_the_comic_strip">First part - the comic strip</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/wiki/index.php?title=540:_Base_System&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2" title="Edit section: First part - the comic strip">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>In the first part, a four frame strip along the top, <a href="/wiki/index.php/Ponytail" title="Ponytail">Ponytail</a> and <a href="/wiki/index.php/Cueball" title="Cueball">Cueball</a> discuss how Cueball's date went. When Cueball answers Ponytail's question with "second base", Ponytail asks what that means exactly. They fumble around with the definition in panel two where Ponytail ask <i>is that Below the waist, but... not under the clothes?</i> Cueball tries to put this into the base system and suggest that this could be compared to the difficult <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortstop" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Shortstop">shortstop</a> fielding position in baseball, between 2nd and 3rd base. This fits with the position of <a href="#The_diamond">Hands on the pants</a> metaphor from the picture below the comic strip. Then Ponytail begins with yet another base analogy by mentioning crossing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_field#Pitcher.27s_mound" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Baseball field">pitcher's mound</a>, but then suddenly she brings two more, very different, sports into the metaphor: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:American football">American football</a> (with the 50 yard line) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Bowling">bowling</a> (with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten-pin" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Ten-pin">ten-pin</a>). It certainly sounds tricky, as Cueball says. Ponytail then brings up a <i>third</i> sport in her elaboration; her reference to getting a "red flag" could refer to different sports, as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag#In_sports" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Flag">many sports use flags</a>, some of them red. It is, however, most likely a reference to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racing_flags#Red_flag" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Racing flags">racing in motor sport</a> as the red flag is displayed when conditions are too dangerous to continue the session. This makes sense when looking at the "translation" here below. Cueball, however, has not got a clue which he expresses when Ponytail asks him <i>If you know what I mean.</i>
(Note that this comic came out less than a week after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XLIII" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Super Bowl XLIII">Super Bowl XLIII</a>, the final game of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_NFL_season" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:2008 NFL season">2008 NFL season</a>, which was played on 2009-02-01).
</p><p>Here is a possible <b>translation</b> of Ponytails comment:
</p>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Original: You should try crossing the <b>pitcher's mound</b>. Then down the <b>50-yard line</b>, and right past her <b>ten-pin</b>. </dd>
<dd>Translation: You should try crossing her <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mons_pubis" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Mons pubis">pubic mound</a></b>, then down the <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bikini_waxing#The_Landing_Strip" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Bikini waxing">landing strip</a></b>, and right past her <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clitoris" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Clitoris">clitoris</a></b>.
<dl><dd>Original: Last time I tried it, <b>I got a red flag</b>.</dd>
<dd>Translation: Last time I tried it, <b>she had her <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstruation" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Menstruation">period</a></b>.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>This would mean that Ponytail was about to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cunnilingus" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Cunnilingus">go down</a> on another girl, while this girl had her period. Many people would find it disgusting to go down on a girl while she was menstruating, explaining why Ponytail brought it up when Cueball said <i>Sounds tricky</i>. However, Cueball doesn't seem to understand Ponytail's metaphors, explaining his replies of <i>Sounds tricky</i> and <i>I really don't</i>.

<p>The second part, the diagram, depicts a much more complex version of the baseball metaphor, where baseball terms and jargon are used to describe the many and varied things human beings like to do in the bedroom. Explanations have been separated by position. In order to understand the terms used, one may want to consult this picture:
</p><p><a href="/wiki/index.php/File:540baseballdiamond.jpg" class="image" title="The baseball diamond and surrounding areas"><img alt="The baseball diamond and surrounding areas" src="/wiki/images/f/ff/540baseballdiamond.jpg" width="580" height="540" /></a>
</p>
<dl><dd>Note that Randall did not include any features from within the diamond; the pitchers mound or plate.</dd></dl>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="The_diamond">The diamond</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/wiki/index.php?title=540:_Base_System&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4" title="Edit section: The diamond">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h4>
<p>The "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_field" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Baseball field">diamond</a>" is the geometric pattern formed by the four bases - first, second, third, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_field#Home_plate" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Baseball field">home plate</a>. Through the course of one side's turn (half of an "inning") players have a chance to move from one base to the next base in line: from first, to second, to third, and finally to home plate (scoring only if they make it to home plate). Thus there is a "progression" from one base to the next of sexual activity in the metaphor, until climax is achieved (getting to 'home plate' and 'scoring a run'). In both cases, players can be removed before making it to the next "base" in the sequence.
</p><p>The entries in this section are ordered roughly from home plate to first, to second, to third, and then to home plate again, in the counterclockwise direction that the players move.
</p>
<ul><li>Eye contact is placed just alongside the initial stage where the 'player' has just stepped off the home plate and is starting to move towards first. This is a deliberate setup for the 'thigh contact' pun later just before home plate. First eye, then thigh contact. First then can the sex begin and you have finally scored by reaching the home plate.</li>
<li>Passing notes refers to a common method of communication in the classroom in school, often used by students as a form of courtship. It is placed halfway between the start and first base - the point at which communication has begun.</li>
<li>First base is kissing. This is one of the most common assigned meanings for what the 'first base' is in the baseball metaphor - as in, "getting to first base".</li>
<li>The boring zone is the point between kissing and sexual teasing or activity - the point where intimacy has become normal but sexual behaviors have not been accepted yet. This is boring for many (stereotypically this goes especially for men). It can also be the point at which a workup is attempted from kissing to gentle stroking and finally to the overt sexual teasing that is found by the time you have gotten to second base.</li>
<li>Second base is licking or hands under the shirt. Overt sexual teasing, in an attempt to get the other person aroused.</li>
<li>'Hands on the pants' and 'hands in the pants' are two activities that happen in a very short distance of each other during an average sexual encounter. They are also separated by the 'orgasm line', indicating that teasing has stopped and actual sexual activity has begun.</li>
<li>Third base is oral sex. Oral sex is often used to prepare or arouse another person in preparation for intercourse, although it can be performed until one or both climax. In older versions of the baseball metaphor, third base was "hands in the pants" instead, which has been moved to earlier on the line in this new, "modern" version - or at least, Randall's conception of it.</li>
<li>The Virginity line, which is also named, in brackets, after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maginot_Line" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Maginot Line">Maginot Line</a>, a series of French fortifications that were thought to be impenetrable during the lead-up to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:World War II">World War II</a>. This line provides a direct "barrier" to the path between third base and a home run. The Maginot Line was thought to be completely impenetrable until it was bypassed by the German army during WW2 through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ardennes_forest" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Ardennes forest">Ardennes forest</a>, whereupon it was encircled and destroyed. Virginity is often seen as an impenetrable barrier, or an unwillingness, up until arousal and desire conspire to make it go away rapidly.</li>
<li>Teens, naturally, having a propensity for hormone-driven sex, bypass the Virginity line with ease.</li>
<li>Sharing root PWs (passwords) is placed very close to home plate. As a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_administrator" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:System administrator">system administrator</a>, the one thing you never, ever do is give anyone the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_password" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Root password">root (core) password</a> to an operating system, because anyone with the password is able to get unlimited access to the system to do whatever they please. Sharing a root password with another person is a nerdy way of saying that you trust them on an intimate, deep level. In other words, it requires more trust than oral sex.</li>
<li>Finally, there is home plate. In this diagram, it is unlabelled, but in all versions of the baseball metaphor, the home plate signifies sexual intercourse and climax. Scoring a "home run" with a sexual partner means you "took it all the way" and "scored a point"; i.e. got laid. Close to the home plate, the virginity line and orgasm line cross, as penetrative sex is rarely the most effective way for a woman to reach orgasm.</li></ul>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Within_the_diamond_and_around_the_orgasm_line">Within the diamond and around the orgasm line</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/wiki/index.php?title=540:_Base_System&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5" title="Edit section: Within the diamond and around the orgasm line">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h4>
<p>Inside the diamond, at the center of the mound, is the pitcher. Several odd positions are placed here in Randall's diagram.
</p>
<ul><li>The Orgasm Line, which passes through almost every other play field, seems to be a divider that runs throughout the entire map that separates teasing and arousing behavior from overt sexual behavior intended to pleasure others. 
<ul><li>Using the scroll thingy on that one Apple mouse is presumably here because the small, rounded scroll button can be imagined to be a clitoris. But it does not even get close to cross the orgasm line. (See also <a href="/wiki/index.php/243:_Appropriate_Term" title="243: Appropriate Term">243: Appropriate Term</a>.) The Apple mouse mentioned is presumably the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Mighty_Mouse" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Apple Mighty Mouse">Apple Mighty Mouse</a>, which has a small scrolling trackball instead of a scroll wheel, which is the usual method on most computer mice.</li>
<li>Fursuits (arousing, to some) become crotchless fursuits (overtly a sexual tool) when they cross the orgasm line. </li>
<li>Hands on the pants and hands in the pants are two related but different activities - hands on the pants is arousing but not past the orgasm line, whereas hands in the pants can give pleasure enough to cross the orgasm line.</li>
<li>Dry humping is the activity of humping (thrusting against) a partner without one or both of them removing their clothes, in order to arouse or gain sexual satisfaction. The location is probably a combination of the fact that it lies somewhere between hands on/in the pants, is definitely not an activity that is considered "out there" (in the outfield), hasn't quite made it to 3rd base, but at least it crosses the orgasm line.</li></ul></li></ul>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Infield">Infield</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/wiki/index.php?title=540:_Base_System&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6" title="Edit section: Infield">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h4>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infield#Baseball" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Infield">infield</a> is the part of the baseball field which is <b>inside</b> the baserunning paths (not inside the lines between the bases, because baserunners are allowed to run a certain distance outside those lines). 
</p>
<ul><li>Napoleon's Forces is a cartography joke, suggesting that all of this complicated positioning makes the image look like a map depicting military maneuvers (and also evoking the comical image of Napoleon's army marching through a land of sexual behaviors). The specific reference is probably to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Joseph_Minard" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Charles Joseph Minard">Charles Joseph Minard</a>'s famous <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Joseph_Minard#/media/File:Minard.png">diagram of Napoleon's 1812 Russian campaign</a>, often cited as the best statistical graphic ever. It's mentioned in the title text of <a href="/wiki/index.php/731:_Desert_Island" title="731: Desert Island">731: Desert Island</a>.</li>
<li>Fursuits are anthropmorphic animal costumes worn by some members of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furry_Fandom" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Furry Fandom">Furry Fandom</a>, people who are fans of anthropomorphized (human-like) animals. Fursuiters are a small fraction of the entire fandom,(though most furries have expressed interest in owning one, some being unable to due to the high cost involved in commissioning one <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.furscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Fur-Science-Final-pdf-for-Website_2017_10_18.pdf">IARP</a>), and are rarely used in sexual play.</li>
<li>Fursuits (crotchless) are fursuits with no fabric or covering on the groin (crotch) of the wearer, and as such are specifically intended for sexual play. They are placed slightly further "out there" on the field due to this being more unusual, and across the orgasm line.</li>
<li>Standing anywhere near Peaches is referring to the musician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peaches_(musician)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Peaches (musician)">Peaches</a> who is known for her heavy use of sexual imagery. </li></ul>

As they separated away from the main play area, the things in the outfield are often references to sexual behaviors that are "kinky" and "out there".
</p>
<ul><li>2outfielders1glove is a reference to the infamous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2girls1cup" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:2girls1cup">2girls1cup</a> scatological site and associated meme.</li>
<li>The <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=retrograde%20wheelbarrow">Retrograde Wheelbarrow</a> is a sex position, one referenced previously in <a href="/wiki/index.php/300:_Facebook" title="300: Facebook">300: Facebook</a>, making this a callback.</li>
<li>Eye contact from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janeane_Garofalo" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Janeane Garofalo">Janeane Garofalo</a> is a tie-in to the "eye contact" entry positioned near home base. It's possible that this is placed in the outfield because fantasizing about celebrities like Janeane Garofalo is a behavior that is often considered unusual, even though many people do it.</li></ul>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Foul_ball">Foul ball</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/wiki/index.php?title=540:_Base_System&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8" title="Edit section: Foul ball">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h4>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foul_ball" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Foul ball">foul ball</a> occurs when a ball ends up in foul territory which is outside the foul line extending from either side of the diamond, the area is "out of play". Anyone who takes the ball into this area has committed a foul, and as such breached one of the acceptable rules of sexual conduct in the metaphor.
</p>
<ul><li>Anal sex is a pun on the term "foul ball", as the anus is where fecal matter collects. The position is placed just outside the foul line.</li>
<li>Downloading Star Trek fanfiction and replacing Riker's name with your crush is a reference to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Star Trek: The Next Generation">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a>. Riker, the First Officer of the Enterprise-D, is often a subject of sexual desire among the fandom, and so taking a piece of fanfiction (fan-written, noncanon stories written about a piece of fiction) and replacing Riker's name with that of your crush is an ultra-nerdy way of indicating that they are attractive - so ultra-nerdy, it's creepy.</li>
<li>The binary (i.e. base 2) numbers are an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:ASCII">ASCII</a> representation of the characters "base 2". The base of a number system is the number of unique digits required to represent numbers in that system. Binary is therefore a "base 2" system. This seems to be a little nerd sniping: wasting the time of anyone familiar enough with computing to know how to decode it.</li>
<li>"Your base" is a reference to the original "base" metaphor mixed with a reference to the Zero Wing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Your_Base" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:All Your Base">All Your Base</a> meme. It is most likely a reference to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masturbation" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Masturbation">masturbation</a> (i.e. solo sex or you-sex and is in the foul area). First you make eye contact with a gorgeous girl (boy) and then you  go home and satisfy yourself with a fantasy about all the things you would like to do with her (him). It's possible that this being here is also a stealth insult towards the reader - the reader's own base (him/herself) is "out of play" and thus undesirable.</li></ul>

<p>If you are together with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Basketball">basketball</a> player and then tell her that you are now <i>at second base</i>, she might become very confused as bases are not an element in basketball. Also there is the joke that basketball players never get laid because they always jump before they score.

<p>Panels 3 &amp; 4 refer to yet other sports.  A 50-yard line is a significant location in American football; a ten-pin is a specific
pin location in bowling; and a red flag is a warning given in non-American football (what Amercians call soccer).

<dl><dd>Soccer has a red card for expulsion from the field, not a flag.

<p>I seriously doubt the 'red flag' has to do with a girl's menstration. A red flag usually is a warning to a player, probably indicating that Ponytail's partner didn't like that action and/or asked her to stop. 23:45, 10 August 2016  <a href="/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/173.245.54.29" title="Special:Contributions/173.245.54.29">173.245.54.29</a>
</p><p>The arrow indicating Napoleon's forces may be a reference to the classic map/diagram by Charles Joseph Minard, which shows not only the path Napoleon's army took on its Russian invasion, but also several other relevant categories of facts about that campaign, thus folding several conceptual dimensions into two.
